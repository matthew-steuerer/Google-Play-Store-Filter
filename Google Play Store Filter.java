Data Source URL: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

Initial Ideas: create a list of objects where each entry in the list is an app object
Each app will have attributes that correspond to column titles
The user needs to be able to filter on up to three of these attributes
Need to confirm if user should be able to apply multiple filters (ex: category type and content rating)
User inputs their criteria and the program needs to find all records that match
Minimum Requirements: Be able to run the program once and return result, user may have to rerun for additional queries
Ideal Requirements: Be able to have program run in a loop and filter on multiple criteria
Shoot for the Stars Requirements: GUI with program logic
